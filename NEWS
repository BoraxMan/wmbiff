Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Release 0.4.0 - unreleased

  * This release is by Neil Spring <nspring@cs.washington.edu>.
  * GNUTLS version 0.3.5 is expected; earlier and later versions
    may be incompatible.
  * askpass: Passwords can be left empty for IMAP: ssh-askpass
    will be used to prompt the user.  See sample.wmbiffrc 
    and wmbiffrc(5).
  * skinfile: Background pixmaps can be specified in .wmbiffrc.
    This has the effect of "skins."  See wmbiffrc(5).
    Add "skinfile=wmbiff-master-contrast.xpm" to .wmbiffrc 
    for a more readable wmbiff.
  * finger: Finger client added - finger a user's mailbox to get its
    status.  Requires perl and finger commands. See wmbiffrc(5).
    Thanks to Andelko Horvat.
  * shell: Improvements to ShellClient - now allows three character 
    text to be printed as status.  If "new" is on the output
    line, the text will be in yellow. Thanks to Andelko Horvat.
  * mbox: Paths can be specified including shell expressions 
    in `'s.  If requested, this feature can be expanded to other 
    clients.  Nested expressions are not supported.
  * Permissions on .wmbiffrc are checked to protect security.
    Only a warning is printed now.  This will degenerate in 
    later releases for .wmbiffrc's that store passwords.
  * Migrated to automake / autoconf to detect defaults for
    ssh-askpass and prepare for future changes.
  * Bugfix to handle -geometry tags with dimension as generated
    by fvwmSaveDesk. The size is ignored. (in Debian 0.3.8-3)

Release 0.3.8 - Tue, 26 Mar 2002 17:17:07 +0100

  * Added GnomeICU support.
  * Added an experimental shell command method which reads the output
    for a given command. See wmbiffrc(5) for details.
  * Debug support moved to runtime, using the -debug switch.
  * Fix for the install rule in Makefile.

Release 0.3.7 - Sun,  3 Feb 2002 23:46:44 +0100

  * No, 0.3.6 never happened :)
  * Removed unneeded auth list fix which broke things.
  * Makefile cleanup, with better FreeBSD support. You can now easily
    use the external GNU regex lib.

Release 0.3.6 - Sun, 27 Jan 2002 20:49:52 +0100

  * Added a new syntax for IMAP, which allows using a "@" in
    the password field. See wmbiffrc(5) for details.
  * Fix for a correct usage of the auth list in IMAP.

Release 0.3.5 - Mon, 14 Jan 2002 02:43:23 +0100

  * Added support for GNUtls 0.3. You can still compile wmbiff using
    GNUtls 0.2.x by removing the GNUTLS_VER=3 define in the Makefile.
  * Fixed password quoting in IMAP logins.

Release 0.3.4 - Fri, 23 Nov 2001 16:56:29 +0100

  * "imaps" is now prefered to "sslimap" in config files. The old type
    is still supported for backwards compatibility.
  * You can now specify what protocol wmbiff should use for a given Pop3
    or IMAP mailbox. If unspecified, it will try the secure ones first,
    falling back to unsecure if they fail. See wmbiffrc(5).
  * Added some debug messages for tls connections.
  * Pop3 path parsing rewrite.
  * Manual page fixes.
  * Compile warning fixes.

Release 0.3.3 - Mon, 29 Oct 2001 14:55:00 +0100

  * Sanity check to IMAP code: exit if wmbiff tries to connect to more
    than 5 servers.
  * Fix a missbehaviour of cram-md5 (broke pop3).
  * Documentation updates.

Release 0.3.2 - Tue, 23 Oct 2001 20:30:37 +0200

  * After some tries (other OpenSSL based patches, independent APOP
    & CRAM-Md5 patches) we've come up with something based on GNUtls and
    gcrypt, which are GPL based and have no licensing issues for us.
    See ChangeLog for details.
  * WMBiff now supports IMAP-SSL, APOP and CRAM-Md5 authentication. These
    can be disabled at compile time, commenting out the WITH_TLS and
    WITH_GCRYPT defines. (Neil Spring, NAKAYAMA Takao and Jay T. Francis).

Release 0.3.1 - Sun, 24 Jun 2001 20:15:41 +0200

  * Replaced /var/spool/mail with /var/mail, which is what the FHS mandates.
    All decent systems should have either the directory or a symlink pointing
    somewhere else. (Jordi Mallach)
  * I reformatted ths changelog, again.  I hope this is the last time I need
    to do this.  The CVS logs should be used for all changes, and this file
    should by updated for user-visible changes only, from now on.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Updated the README to reflect that Gennady Belyakov died right after
    releasing wmBiff 0.2.  May your soul rest in peace, Gennady.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Fixed the IMAP support, again. (Rob Funk)


Release 0.3.0 - Fri, 16 May 2001 12:16:44 +0200

  * [ReadLine] removed previous trim leading spaces, added TrimFull.  Fixes
    Debian Bug #95849 (Mark Hurley).
  * There was a bug where if a POP3 or IMAP mailbox read failed and the
    following reads were successful, but no mail was in the server, the given
    mailbox would remain reading "XX". Now it updates the counter no matter
    what the read was (Mark Hurley).
  * wmBiff would only count as new mails in mbox mailboxes with "N" flags,
    ignoring those marked "ON" (Rob Funk).
  * Fixed reading of quoted imap folders, which some IMAPd's do (Rob Funk).
  * README: updated some very obsolete info. (Jordi Mallach)


Release 0.2q1+Debian - Tue,  1 May 2001 10:11:00 +0000

  * Moved to CVS at SourceForge. (Jordi Mallach)


Release 0.2q1 - Fri, 13 Apr 2001 02:47:10 -0400

  * This release is by Mark Hurley <debian4tux@telocity.com>.
  * wmbiff/Client.h: move DEBUG_* macros to wmbiff/Makefile
  * wmbiff/Pop3Client.c:
    + My password contains an  @  character.  This causes
      the pop3 line to be incorrectly parsed by wmbiff.
      * Drop all of the ":" after the pop3 and delimit all values with
        spaces.  This works well, as passwords/user-id's all agree that
        the space is a non-legit value.
         
        Example: assume my password is:  myEmailhasa@init
         
        Old way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux:myEmailhasa@init@mail.telocity.com

        New way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux myEmailhasa@init mail.telcoity.com
        
        Ahh...before you say it.  "Backward compatibility?" You will
        also find in the patch, a NEW function.  So that the OLD and
        NEW way is easily compatible with all ".wmbiffrc" files.
        
        Dev. Comments:
        This was not the cleanest way to implement it, but I had to
        suffice with a clean/quick implementation.  I originally wrote
        one function to handle past and new parsing.  However, I
        thought it would be beneficial to leave them separated, so we
        could eventually drop the old method?
        
        Related Changes:
        The man page will need to be updated (not provided in patch).
        We can weed the "old" style out of the example script as well.
        Still explaining the changes in the man page to leave out
        confusion in a users mind (as they are likely to find "old"
        style scripts).
    + My mail server at Telocity.com is following the RFC's to
      a "T".  RFC 1725 states that the LAST command be removed.
      After some searching I have NOT turned up a replacement.
      Which does make sense, this command is only so useful,
      and contributes to the popularity of other such remoting
      such as LDAP?
      * I've set the Unread messages to the TotalMessages,
        assuming (as suggested by the RFC) no messages have been
        read.  I have also suppressed the error printed to
        stderr, it is correct to return an error, *now*.  ;)

        The only way to keep track of messages which have been
        read, is to remember the unique number assigned to them.
        This is what fetchmail does.  However, it does not work
        correctly if you check and read mail thru other methods
        (a web mail client).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c:
        -       for (index = 0; index < 4; index++)
        +       for (index = 0; index < 5; index++)
    
        BUG!  Last postion #4 was not correctly being checked.
        Now correctly checks each position.


Release 0.2q - Tue, 20 Mar 2001 05:32:35 +0100

  * This release is by Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es>.
  * wmbiff/{*.[ch]}: removed unnecesary includes.
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: some cleanups and optimizations. 
    + init_biff:
      * show error if user config file does not exists
      * use of userconfig "interval" (wasn't correctly parsed)
    + {do_biff, displayMsgCounters}: some changes to make Sleep_Interval
      and Blink_Mode local
    + parse_cmd: some changes to make uconfig_file local
    + {BlinkOn, BlinkOff, BlinkToogle}: Removed (merged by do_biff)
    + {ReadConfigString, ReadConfigInt}: Removed 
    + countmail: removed init in header (wasn't used)
    + ReadLine: Created (new parsing code, extracts pairs of setting
      and value)
    + Read_Config_File: now there is only ONE parse not 36!
  * wmbiff/{IMap4Client.c, Pop3Client.c}: check for correct format line to 
    avoid "segmentation fault" while parsing.

  * This release is by Yong-iL Joh <tolkien@mizi.com>.
  * I don't think the date of this changelog entry is right.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>, Debian's wmbiff maintainer, sent
    me an email a couple of days ago which included a patch with man pages.
    The patch did the following:
      + Fixed a major upstream bug that renders this new wmbiff unusable.
        Thanks to Guillaume Morin, Jérôme Marant and Mark Hurley for their
        help identifying the bug, and Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> for
        writing a patch. Basically, the new upstream broke backwards
        compatibility of wmbiffrc with Gennady's wmbiff, fixed that.
        This patch also fixes wmbiff not using $MAIL or defaulting to
        /var/spool/mail/$USER if no ~/.wmbiffrc is found (closes: #87778).
      + wmbiff/wmbiff.c: updated WMBIFF_VERSION to current.
      + wmbiff/{socket.c, wmbiff.c}: removed <sys/time.h> includes.
      + debian/{wmbiff.1, wmbiffrc.5}: updated for IMAP4 and Licq support.
      + Jorge García removed the segfault in Jordi's wmbiffrc
      + Vladimir Popov <pva48@mail.ru> fixed a potential buffer overflow
        in init_biff() (The "/* Make labels look right */" section).
      + Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> fixed a display bug in the
        number-of- mails display.
  * use poll() instead of select()
