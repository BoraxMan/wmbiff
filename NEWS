Release Notes
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Release 0.3.2 - Mon, 24 Sep 2001 13:41:16 +0200

  * Added APOP support from NAKAYAMA Takao.
  * Updates and fixes to documentation. (Jordi)


Release 0.3.1 - Sun, 24 Jun 2001 20:15:41 +0200

  * Replaced /var/spool/mail with /var/mail, which is what the FHS mandates.
    All decent systems should have either the directory or a symlink pointing
    somewhere else. (Jordi Mallach)
  * I reformatted ths changelog, again.  I hope this is the last time I need
    to do this.  The CVS logs should be used for all changes, and this file
    should by updated for user-visible changes only, from now on.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Updated the README to reflect that Gennady Belyakov died right after
    releasing wmBiff 0.2.  May your soul rest in peace, Gennady.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Fixed the IMAP support, again. (Rob Funk)


Release 0.3.0 - Fri, 16 May 2001 12:16:44 +0200

  * [ReadLine] removed previous trim leading spaces, added TrimFull.  Fixes
    Debian Bug #95849 (Mark Hurley).
  * There was a bug where if a POP3 or IMAP mailbox read failed and the
    following reads were successful, but no mail was in the server, the given
    mailbox would remain reading "XX". Now it updates the counter no matter
    what the read was (Mark Hurley).
  * wmBiff would only count as new mails in mbox mailboxes with "N" flags,
    ignoring those marked "ON" (Rob Funk).
  * Fixed reading of quoted imap folders, which some IMAPd's do (Rob Funk).
  * README: updated some very obsolete info. (Jordi Mallach)


Release 0.2q1+Debian - Tue,  1 May 2001 10:11:00 +0000

  * Moved to CVS at SourceForge. (Jordi Mallach)


Release 0.2q1 - Fri, 13 Apr 2001 02:47:10 -0400

  * This release is by Mark Hurley <debian4tux@telocity.com>.
  * wmbiff/Client.h: move DEBUG_* macros to wmbiff/Makefile
  * wmbiff/Pop3Client.c:
    + My password contains an  @  character.  This causes
      the pop3 line to be incorrectly parsed by wmbiff.
      * Drop all of the ":" after the pop3 and delimit all values with
        spaces.  This works well, as passwords/user-id's all agree that
        the space is a non-legit value.
         
        Example: assume my password is:  myEmailhasa@init
         
        Old way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux:myEmailhasa@init@mail.telocity.com

        New way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux myEmailhasa@init mail.telcoity.com
        
        Ahh...before you say it.  "Backward compatibility?" You will
        also find in the patch, a NEW function.  So that the OLD and
        NEW way is easily compatible with all ".wmbiffrc" files.
        
        Dev. Comments:
        This was not the cleanest way to implement it, but I had to
        suffice with a clean/quick implementation.  I originally wrote
        one function to handle past and new parsing.  However, I
        thought it would be beneficial to leave them separated, so we
        could eventually drop the old method?
        
        Related Changes:
        The man page will need to be updated (not provided in patch).
        We can weed the "old" style out of the example script as well.
        Still explaining the changes in the man page to leave out
        confusion in a users mind (as they are likely to find "old"
        style scripts).
    + My mail server at Telocity.com is following the RFC's to
      a "T".  RFC 1725 states that the LAST command be removed.
      After some searching I have NOT turned up a replacement.
      Which does make sense, this command is only so useful,
      and contributes to the popularity of other such remoting
      such as LDAP?
      * I've set the Unread messages to the TotalMessages,
        assuming (as suggested by the RFC) no messages have been
        read.  I have also suppressed the error printed to
        stderr, it is correct to return an error, *now*.  ;)

        The only way to keep track of messages which have been
        read, is to remember the unique number assigned to them.
        This is what fetchmail does.  However, it does not work
        correctly if you check and read mail thru other methods
        (a web mail client).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c:
        -       for (index = 0; index < 4; index++)
        +       for (index = 0; index < 5; index++)
    
        BUG!  Last postion #4 was not correctly being checked.
        Now correctly checks each position.


Release 0.2q - Tue, 20 Mar 2001 05:32:35 +0100

  * This release is by Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es>.
  * wmbiff/{*.[ch]}: removed unnecesary includes.
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: some cleanups and optimizations. 
    + init_biff:
      * show error if user config file does not exists
      * use of userconfig "interval" (wasn't correctly parsed)
    + {do_biff, displayMsgCounters}: some changes to make Sleep_Interval
      and Blink_Mode local
    + parse_cmd: some changes to make uconfig_file local
    + {BlinkOn, BlinkOff, BlinkToogle}: Removed (merged by do_biff)
    + {ReadConfigString, ReadConfigInt}: Removed 
    + countmail: removed init in header (wasn't used)
    + ReadLine: Created (new parsing code, extracts pairs of setting
      and value)
    + Read_Config_File: now there is only ONE parse not 36!
  * wmbiff/{IMap4Client.c, Pop3Client.c}: check for correct format line to 
    avoid "segmentation fault" while parsing.

  * Massive (lack of) coding style cleanup; Standardized coding style using

  * Cleaned up the v0.2o ChangeLog entry.  What a mess!  Added missing credits.
  * Cleaned up and reformatted the rest of the changelog to an almost-Debian
    format while I'm at it.  It's much more readable that way.
  * Moved definition of WMBIFF_VERSION to the Makefile.

Release 0.2o - Mon, 12 Mar 2001 00:00:00 +0900

  * This release is by Yong-iL Joh <tolkien@mizi.com>.
  * I don't think the date of this changelog entry is right.
    (Dwayne C. Litzenberger)
  * Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>, Debian's wmbiff maintainer, sent
    me an email a couple of days ago which included a patch with man pages.
    The patch did the following:
      + Fixed a major upstream bug that renders this new wmbiff unusable.
        Thanks to Guillaume Morin, Jérôme Marant and Mark Hurley for their
        help identifying the bug, and Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> for
        writing a patch. Basically, the new upstream broke backwards
        compatibility of wmbiffrc with Gennady's wmbiff, fixed that.
        This patch also fixes wmbiff not using $MAIL or defaulting to
        /var/spool/mail/$USER if no ~/.wmbiffrc is found (closes: #87778).
      + wmbiff/wmbiff.c: updated WMBIFF_VERSION to current.
      + wmbiff/{socket.c, wmbiff.c}: removed <sys/time.h> includes.
      + debian/{wmbiff.1, wmbiffrc.5}: updated for IMAP4 and Licq support.
      + Jorge García removed the segfault in Jordi's wmbiffrc
      + Vladimir Popov <pva48@mail.ru> fixed a potential buffer overflow
        in init_biff() (The "/* Make labels look right */" section).
      + Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> fixed a display bug in the
        number-of- mails display.
  * use poll() instead of select()

  * This release is by Yong-iL Joh <tolkien@mizi.com>.

    that enhances the following:
