  * wmbiff/Makefile: replaced hardcoded `gcc' calls with $(CC).
  * wmbiff/sample.wmbiffrc, wmbiff/wmbiff.c: replace /var/spool/mail 
    with /var/mail, which is what the FHS mandates. All decent
    systems should have either the directory or a symlink pointing
    somewhere else.

  * wmbiff/charutil.c: fixed gcc-3.0 implicit warning, but including string.h
    also cleaned up other includes in same file
 
wmBiff (0.3.0)
  * wmbiff/Makefile:
    + added charutil.o to OBJS (Mark Hurley).
    + little cosmetic changes and remove wmbiff-master.xpm.
  * wmbiff/Imap4Client.c: removed two unused variables in imap4CheckMail
    (Mark Hurley).
  * wmbiff/charutil.c: added for TrimLeft, TrimRight, TrimFull (also .h)
    (Mark Hurley).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: [ReadLine] removed previous trim leading spaces, added
    TrimFull.  Fixes Debian Bug #95849 (Mark Hurley).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: if a pop3 or imap mailbox read fails and the following
    reads are successful but no mail was in the server, the given mailbox
    would remain reading "XX". Now it updates the counter no matter what the
    read was (Mark Hurley).
  * wmbiff/mboxClient.c: wmbiff would only count as new mails those with "N"
    flags, ignoring those marked "ON" (Rob Funk).
  * wmbiff/Imap4Client.c: fixed reading of quoted imap folders, which some
    IMAPd's do (Rob Funk).
  * README: updated some very obsolete info.

wmBiff (0.2q1)
  * wmbiff/Client.h: move DEBUG_* macros to wmbiff/Makefile
  * wmbiff/Pop3Client.c:
    + My password contains an  @  character.  This causes
      the pop3 line to be incorrectly parsed by wmbiff.
      * Drop all of the ":" after the pop3 and delimit all values with
        spaces.  This works well, as passwords/user-id's all agree that
        the space is a non-legit value.
         
        Example: assume my password is:  myEmailhasa@init
         
        Old way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux:myEmailhasa@init@mail.telocity.com

        New way:
        path.3=pop3:debian4tux myEmailhasa@init mail.telcoity.com
        
        Ahh...before you say it.  "Backward compatibility?" You will
        also find in the patch, a NEW function.  So that the OLD and
        NEW way is easily compatible with all ".wmbiffrc" files.
        
        Dev. Comments:
        This was not the cleanest way to implement it, but I had to
        suffice with a clean/quick implementation.  I originally wrote
        one function to handle past and new parsing.  However, I
        thought it would be beneficial to leave them separated, so we
        could eventually drop the old method?
        
        Related Changes:
        The man page will need to be updated (not provided in patch).
        We can weed the "old" style out of the example script as well.
        Still explaining the changes in the man page to leave out
        confusion in a users mind (as they are likely to find "old"
        style scripts).
    + My mail server at Telocity.com is following the RFC's to
      a "T".  RFC 1725 states that the LAST command be removed.
      After some searching I have NOT turned up a replacement.
      Which does make sense, this command is only so useful,
      and contributes to the popularity of other such remoting
      such as LDAP?
      * I've set the Unread messages to the TotalMessages,
        assuming (as suggested by the RFC) no messages have been
        read.  I have also suppressed the error printed to
        stderr, it is correct to return an error, *now*.  ;)

        The only way to keep track of messages which have been
        read, is to remember the unique number assigned to them.
        This is what fetchmail does.  However, it does not work
        correctly if you check and read mail thru other methods
        (a web mail client).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c:
        -       for (index = 0; index < 4; index++)
        +       for (index = 0; index < 5; index++)
    
        BUG!  Last postion #4 was not correctly being checked.
        Now correctly checks each position.

wmBiff (0.2q)
  * wmbiff/{*.[ch]}: removed unnecesary includes.
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: some cleanups and optimizations. 
    + init_biff:
      * show error if user config file does not exists
      * use of userconfig "interval" (wasn't correctly parsed)
    + {do_biff, displayMsgCounters}: some changes to make Sleep_Interval
      and Blink_Mode local
    + parse_cmd: some changes to make uconfig_file local
    + {BlinkOn, BlinkOff, BlinkToogle}: Removed (merged by do_biff)
    + {ReadConfigString, ReadConfigInt}: Removed 
    + countmail: removed init in header (wasn't used)
    + ReadLine: Created (new parsing code, extracts pairs of setting
      and value)
    + Read_Config_File: now there is only ONE parse not 36!
  * wmbiff/{IMap4Client.c, Pop3Client.c}: check for correct format line to 
    avoid "segmentation fault" while parsing.

wmBiff (0.2o)

  * Jordi Mallach <jordi@sindominio.net>, Debian's wmbiff maintainer, sent
    me an email a couple of days ago which included a patch with man pages.
    The patch did the following:
      + Fixed a major upstream bug that renders this new wmbiff unusable.
        Thanks to Guillaume Morin, Jérôme Marant and Mark Hurley for their
        help identifying the bug, and Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> for
        writing a patch. Basically, the new upstream broke backwards
        compatibility of wmbiffrc with Gennady's wmbiff, fixed that.
        This patch also fixes wmbiff not using $MAIL or defaulting to
        /var/spool/mail/$USER if no ~/.wmbiffrc is found (closes: #87778).
      + wmbiff/wmbiff.c: updated WMBIFF_VERSION to current.
      + wmbiff/{socket.c, wmbiff.c}: removed <sys/time.h> includes.
      + debian/{wmbiff.1, wmbiffrc.5}: updated for IMAP4 and Licq support.
      + Jorge García removed the segfault in Jordi's wmbiffrc
      + Vladimir Popov <pva48@mail.ru> fixed a potential buffer overflow
        in init_biff() (The "/* Make labels look right */" section).
      + Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> fixed a display bug in the
        number-of- mails display.
  * use poll() instead of select()

      + Config file now supports IMAP mailbox "paths" rather than
        just the mailbox name (e.g. mail/foo/blah)
