   
                                  Introducing
                                       
   wmBiff is an WindowMaker docking utility, that displays number of
   total messages count or unread mail messages count in differrent
   mailboxes.

   Green ( cyan? :) ) digits display total number of messages, if there
   are no unread messages in it.
   
   Yellow digits display number of unread messages, with blinking on new
   mail arrival, if any.
   
   At this moment only unix-style and POP3 mailboxes are supported.
   wmBiff supports up to 5 mailboxes (but you can start 2 or more
   wmbiff's with differrent configs).
   
   Pressing on a 1st (left) mouse button will execute appropriate mail
   reader (if defined in config file). Right-clicking will exec mail
   fetching program (if any).
   
   It is also possible to execute user-defined command line on new mail
   arrival (for example, play .WAV file).

                          Compiling and Installation
                                       
Extract the archive:
        tar -xvzf wmbiff-0.2.tar.gz

Enter the wmbiff directory and edit the Makefile:
        cd wmbiff-0.2/
        vi Makefile

Make the binary:
        make

Install the binary:
        make install

This will copy the binary to /usr/local/bin

Then you need to copy sample.wmbiffrc into your home directory as
.wmbiffrc, correct it as you like. Or, you can use the ``-c'' option
and specify differrent name of config file.
 Without any config file wmbiff will use only default mailbox
(from environment variable MAIL), labeled with word SPOOL, at first
position. All other positions will be empty.
