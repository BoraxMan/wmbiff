- Store and verify server certificates.
- Add a FAQ (sighup, app size, deleted messages)
- Make the shell method support old messages too
- Add more shell "recipes" besides gicu.
- Support "skins" or soft-configurable xpms for,
   for example, 8bpp displays or non 64x64 appsizes.
- Support on/off status LED's, for, for example,
   grep eth0 /proc/net/dev | wc -l
- Add a failure-expect case in tlsComm. For example,
   an IMAP status query has a good response (* STATUS) 
   and a bad response (a003 NO STATUS).  As soon as 
   one of them is received, we're done.
