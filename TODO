This is not a prioritized list.  Patches that accomplish
these todo items are welcome.

* Font support
** Allow a new color other than yellow
** Allow a background color other than black
** Allow a different label color
** Erase counts > 1000 successfully (redraw the whole line)
** Discover height of the font, scale appropriately.
** Draw relative to symbolic width, height.
* Finish checking .wmbiffrc permissions.
  With shell command execution support, it is even more
  important to protect against other/group writability.
  With passwords in the .wmbiffrc, .wmbiffrc shouldn't be
  readable.  It might be best to complain all the time, but
  only abort when a password is used from a readable file,
  or a shell command is executed from a writable file.
* Update for GNUTLS 0.4.x 
  GNUTLS changes its API on just about every release,
  generally to support additional functionality.  WMBiff
  will only release with support for one version of GNUTLS,
  likely whatever is in Debian unstable at the time.
* Store and verify server certificates. 
  Mutt will do this, but it seems to require a lot of code
  that should perhaps be part of gnutls. If anyone is
  interested in taking Andrew McDonald's gnutls for mutt
  support and applying it to wmbiff, I'd accept the patch.
* Optionally grab From / Subject for new IMAP on rightclick
  The sequence of commands "examine $mailbox" "search new"
  "fetch $msgnums (body[header.fields(from subject)])" "close"
  should do the trick for grabbing the relevant info; then
  what remains is to blit that onto a window and display it.
  This feature inspired by popcheck.
* \ line continuations in configuration file.
  Because shell commands can be quite long.
* Generic constructors for mboxes.  
  There's some common code across different Clients;
  this is one piece that could use refactoring.
* Add more shell "recipes" besides gicu.
  Just added 'finger'.  I'm hoping to add something to
  integrate 'remind' just as soon as I can figure it out.
* Support on/off status LED's, for, for example,
  grep eth0 /proc/net/dev | wc -l
  The colored LED's are already in WMBiff's pixmap.
* Support buttons 4 and 5
  The mousewheel could be useful for some behaviors, like
  controlling volume, or selecting different mailboxes.
* Use a helper program to blink keyboard led's.
  Requires killing the 'notify' program when new mail no
  longer exists.  Keyboard blinking is done via a helper
  program because it requires root.  ledcontrol seems ok,
  but extra complicated, and has a useless default install
  that requires root.  xbuffy's led program seems quite
  good, but depending on another biff program seems odd.
* Add a failure-expect case in tlsComm. 
  For example, an IMAP status query has a good response (*
  STATUS) and a bad response (a003 NO STATUS).  As soon as
  one of them is received, we're done.
* Reload .wmbiffrc when it changes
  This is straightforward, except for IMAP mailboxes that
  keep a connection to the server open.  A close function
  will have to be implemented to shut those down gracefully.
  Do not involve sighup or any other signals.  Use or
  improve fileHasChanged().
* Runtime back-tick expansion for non-mbox
  Because interesting mailboxes can be defined by date,
  though its not clear any other clients can take advantage.
* Support GSSAPI or SASL authentication
  Authentication using krb5 would be sweet.

* Unlikely to get done, unless someone volunteers:
* KDE/Gnome users: Test with KDE or gnome-panel
  Does Debian bug #108529 apply to wmbiff?  Can wmbiff
  be swallowed by gnome-panel?  It seems possible.  It 
  appears to be swallowed by FVWM correctly.
* Autoconf / Automake Wizards: fix FromCVS.sh
  How best to deal with libgnutls's macros?  All 
  I can do is hack.
* Paranoid Pop People: Support POP over TLS.
  tlsComm.c should make it easy to provide TLS support
  for POP.  Unfortunately, this would only be useful for
  someone who has such a server that doesn't support IMAPS.
* MH support
  Try "path.n=shell:::ls -1 directoryname | wc -l".
  If it works, tell us.  Optionally the patch at sourceforge
  could be integrated.
