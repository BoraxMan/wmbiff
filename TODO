* Store and verify server certificates. 
  I don't know whether gnutls supports this.  A pointer to
  documentation that describes what to do, or a way to leech
  stored certificates or CA's from mutt would be great.
* Runtime back-tick expansion
  Because interesting mailboxes can be defined by date.
* \ line continuations in configuration file.
  Because shell commands can be quite long.
* Generic constructors for mboxes.  
  There's a lot of common code across different Clients;
  this is one piece that could use refactoring.
* Add more shell "recipes" besides gicu.
  Just added 'finger'.  I'm hoping to add something to
  integrate 'remind' just as soon as I can figure it out.
* Support on/off status LED's, for, for example,
  grep eth0 /proc/net/dev | wc -l
  The colored LED's are already in WMBiff's pixmap.
* Use a helper program to blink keyboard led's.
  Requires killing the 'notify' program when new mail no
  longer exists.  Keyboard blinking is done via a helper
  program because it requires root.  ledcontrol seems ok,
  but extra complicated, and has a useless default install
  that requires root.  xbuffy's led program seems quite
  good, but depending on another biff program seems odd.
* Add a failure-expect case in tlsComm. 
  For example, an IMAP status query has a good response (*
  STATUS) and a bad response (a003 NO STATUS).  As soon as
  one of them is received, we're done.


* Unlikely to get done, unless someone volunteers:
* Support pops
  tlsComm.c should make it easy to provide TLS support
  for POP.  Unfortunately, this would only be useful for
  someone who has such a server that doesn't support IMAPS.
