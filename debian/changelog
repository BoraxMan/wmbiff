  * New upstream release.
  * Patches merged upstream again.
  * wmbiff/Makefile: *sigh*, again he forgot to bump the version number.

    + wmbiff/Imap4Client.c: fix for imap servers which quote the folder
      name (closes: #95077)
    + wmbiff/mboxClient.c: wmbiff only considered new mails those which
      had a "N" as first flag, so "ON" messages wouldn't be shown as new
      (closes: #95128)
    Thanks Rob!
  * Mark Hurley sent another patch, which fixes a little issue with empty
    mailboxes not updating (closes: #94450).

wmbiff (0.2n-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * The `if you want to test, install the appropriate package' release.
  * Fixed a major upstream bug that renders this new wmbiff unusable.
    Thanks to Guillaume Morin, Jérôme Marant and Mark Hurley for their
    help identifying the bug, and Jorge García <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es> for
    writing a patch. Basically, the new upstream broke backwards
    compatibility of wmbiffrc with Gennady's wmbiff, fixed that.
    This patch also fixes wmbiff not using $MAIL or defaulting to
    /var/spool/mail/$USER if no ~/.wmbiffrc is found (closes: #87778).
  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c: updated WMBIFF_VERSION to current "0.2n".
  * wmbiff/{socket.c, wmbiff.c}: removed <sys/time.h> includes.
  * debian/{wmbiff.1, wmbiffrc.5}: updated for IMAP4 and Licq support.
  * debian/rules: quote around $(CFLAGS), oops. No wonder how I found this,
    right?

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Thu,  1 Mar 2001 22:57:51 +0100

wmbiff (0.2n-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream release, from a fork. I've been doing Google searches for
    Gennady Belyakov since December 1999, when he started to be
    unresponsive, without positive results. Mark Hurley just told me there
    was some guy releasing new versions, so I'll use Yong-iL Joh's branch
    from now on. This new version adds licq and IMAP4 support, and more.
  * Reapplied the patches to this new version, some of them seem to be
    obsolete by upstream changes... there's no changelog, so it's a bit hard
    to know.
  * Applied the patches from OpenBSD's port.
  * wmbiff/Makefile: changes to install rule.
  * debian/rules:
    + DH_COMPAT=3 and the changes needed
    + DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS support
    + s/`pwd`/$(CURDIR)
  * debian/control:
    + Standards-Version: 3.5.2.0
    + Updated Build-Depends for X4
    + removed Suggests: menu
    + updated Description.
  * debian/copyright: updated authors and URL.
  * debian/manpages: added for dh_installman.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Mon, 26 Feb 2001 14:47:21 +0100

wmbiff (0.2-4) unstable; urgency=low

  * wmbiff/wmbiff.c:
    + add an ifdef to get rid of that stupid, annoying
      debug message that bloated all our .xsession-errors files. This should
      have been fixed about 6 months ago, how lazy.
    + apply patch from Jorge Garcia <Jorge.Garcia@uv.es>: if a mailbox has
      > 1000 messages and after a rescan less than 1000 remain, the first
      character in the number display should be removed (closes: #63048).
      The patch also fixes a possible segfault when too many files are open.
  * debian/control:
    + changed maintainer email address.
    + added Build-Depends.
  * debian/wmbiffrc.5: months late, wmbiffrc finally has its manpage.
  * debian/wmbiff.1: small modifications to reflect the new wmbiffrc.5.
  * debian/rules:
    + install wmbiffrc.5.
    + revert changes to wmbiff/Makefile, all the modifications are handled
      here now.
  * In advance to Overfiend's rage and destruction against /usr/X11R6, I'm
    installing the binary and manpages in /usr, and removing the "1x" suffix
    to the manpage. Conforms with new Policy 3.2.0.0.
  * Upload the tar.gz as well, the old one was broken.

 -- Jordi Mallach <jordi@debian.org>  Fri, 11 Aug 2000 04:16:03 +0200

wmbiff (0.2-2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Wrote a manpage for wmbiff. I still need to write a wmbiffrc(5)
