[-display <display name>] [-geometry +XPOS+YPOS] [-c <filename>] [-h] [-v] [-debug] [-fg <foreground-color>] [-font <X11 font>|default]
.br

.SH DESCRIPTION
WMbiff displays the status of up to five mailboxes. It gives information
about new mail, if any, or total number of messages. It also has mail
retrieval capabilies, and can be configured to do this automatically. At the
moment, UNIX-style, maildir, POP3, APOP and IMAP4 mailboxes are supported.
WMbiff also supports Licq history files and gnomeicu, displaying the number of new
messages in your running session, as if they were mail.  

The mailboxes are displayed in 5 different lines, each one with its own
description of up to five chars. If no mail is present in a given mailbox,
WMbiff will display the total number of mails in cyan. If there's new mail
in the box, the number of new messages will be displayed in yellow. When new
mail arrives, this number will optionally flash for a small period of time,
and also optionally, a command can be executed on mail arrival (for example,
opening your mail reader or playing a sound file).

Pressing mouse button 1 will execute a command, defined in the user's config
file. Mouse button 3 will execute a command to fetch mail, if defined.
