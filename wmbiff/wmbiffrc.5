.TH WMBIFFRC 5 "January 27, 2002" "wmbiff"

.SH NAME
wmbiffrc \- configuration file for
.BR wmbiff (1)

.SH DESCRIPTION
\fBWMbiff\fP is a mail notification tool for the WindowMaker and AfterStep
window managers. It can handle up to 5 mailboxes, and you can define actions
on mouse clicks for the different mailboxes. This manpage explains the
different options which can be specified in a user's wmbiffrc.

.SH OPTIONS
Each option takes the form
.IR option[.mbox] " = " value .
Comment must be preceeded by pound signs (#).

The supported configuration options are:

.TP 4
\fBinterval\fP
Global interval between mailbox checking. Value is the number of seconds, 5
is the default.
.TP
\fBlabel.n\fP
Specifies the displayed label for a mailbox. It can be up to five characters
long.
.TP
\fBpath.n\fP
Path to the mailbox, local or remote one. Path lines start with a prefix,
which specifies the type of wmbiff box you're setting up. The following types
are supported:
.RS
.TP
.I mbox
This is a local mbox mailbox. After the prefix, you only need to put the
path to the mailbox wmbiff needs to read.  This is also the default.
.RS
mbox:/path/to/mail/debian-devel
.RS
- or -
.RE
/path/to/mail/debian-devel
.RE
.TP
.I maildir
\fBMaildir mailboxes are now supported!\fP
This works just like \fImbox\fP above.  After the prefix, you need to put
the path to the maildir wmbiff will read.
.RS
maildir:/path/to/mail/bugtraq/
.RE
.TP
.I pop3
Using this type, wmbiff will fetch mail from a pop3 server, using the
specified username, password, host and an optional port number (defaulting
to 110). If your password contained special character, eg. '@' or ':',
use another path format.  See Authentication below for a description of 
the auth field. 
.RS
pop3:user:passwd@server[:port] [auth]
.RE
.RS
pop3:user passwd server[ port] [auth] 
.RE
.TP
.I imap
These are IMAP4 boxes. As with pop3, wmbiff will read a imap4 mbox using
the given values and will display info about the remote mail. This type
accepts user, password, host and optional path to mailbox and port number.
See Authentication below for a description of the auth field.
.RS
imap:user:passwd@server[/mailbox][:port] [auth]
.RE
.RS
imap:user passwd server[/mailbox][ port] [auth]
.RE
.TP
.I imaps
These are IMAP4 boxes wrapped in a TLS (SSL) connection, only available if 
wmbiff was compiled with TLS support.  Parameters are the same as those for 
ordinary IMAP4 boxes.  Port defaults to 993. If 143 is specified, 
wmbiff will attempt to connect unencrypted but negotiate TLS using
IMAP's STARTTLS command.  TLS support uses gnutls, which is under development
and may be insecure.  TLS support is only for encryption: since certificates
are not yet checked, it is vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attack.
.RS
imaps:user:passwd@server[/mailbox][:port] [auth]
.RE
.RS
imaps:user passwd server[/mailbox][ port] [auth]
.RE
.TP
.I licq
With this box type, wmbiff will read the given history file and track the
number of messages in it. It just needs a path to a given licq history file.
.RS
licq:/path/to/.licq/history/file.history
.RE
.RE
.TP
\fBnotify.n\fP
Command to be executed on new mail arrival in the given mailbox. Accepts
the special keyword "beep" to use the pc speaker.
.TP
\fBaction.n\fP
Command to be executed on left mouse click on a mailbox label.
.TP
\fBinterval.n\fP
Per mailbox check interval. Value is the amount of seconds between
checkings, default is the global interval.
.TP
\fBfetchinterval.n\fP
Interval between mail auto-fetching. Values accept 0 to disable, -1 for
autofetching on new mail arrival, and positive values for a given interval
in seconds.
.TP
\fBfetchcmd.n\fP
Command to be executed to fetch mail. If not specified, fetching through
wmbiff is disabled completely.
.TP
\fBdebug.n\fP 
Show debugging messages from this mailbox.  Currently
supported values are "all" and "none".  The \-debug option
to wmbiff overrides this setting.  Since IMAP uses a single
connection per server, per-mailbox debugging may not

.SH AUTHENTICATION

Authentication methods include "cram-md5", "apop" (for
Pop3), and "plaintext".  "cram-md5" and "apop" are only
available when wmbiff is compiled with libgcrypt.
Authentication methods are tried in the following order:
cram-md5, apop, plaintext.

Each authentication method will be tried unless a list is
included in the [auth] field.  For example, append "cram-md5
apop" if you don't want your password to be sent in
cleartext over the network.  Conversely, append "plaintext"
if you don't want wmbiff to bother with other authentication
methods.  Leaving authentication methods unspecified should
be reasonably safe.  The order of entries in the [auth] list
is not currently considered.

.SH TROUBLESHOOTING

For problems authenticating to servers, try specifying the
authentication method explicitly as described above:
sometimes a failed attempt to authenticate can cause later
failures.  Some servers claim to support cram-md5 but fail:
telling wmbiff not totry can help.

For other problems, run wmbiff with the -debug option.  See
wmbiff(1) for details.
